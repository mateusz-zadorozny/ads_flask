            <strong>P-value:</strong> This number helps us understand if the difference we see between two groups is
            real
            or just happened by luck. Imagine you flip a coin 100 times and it lands on heads 60 times. The P-value
            helps
            you figure out if the coin might be special (like having a higher chance of landing on heads) or if it's
            just
            a normal coin and you got heads 60 times by chance.
            <br>
            For example:
        <ul>
            <li>A small P-value (less than 0.05) means the difference is probably real and not just by chance. This is
                usually
                good.</li>
            <li>A large P-value (greater than 0.05) means the difference might just be due to luck.</li>
        </ul>
        In our case, a P-value of {{ recommendation['p_value'] }} means that there's a {{ recommendation['p_value'] *
        100 }}%
        chance that the difference in performance between
        the groups is due to luck.
